This is an optional project and is basically about installing and setting up a VM on our personal device.
Firstly, we need to understand what a VM is. A VM is a computer system that runs inside another computer system. It allows us to run separate systems on the same machine without having to worry about obtaining another device.

Once we understood that, we were tasked with downloading and installing Vagrant and Virtual Box on our devices, then creating VMs through various CLIs on either CMD or terminal on our personal devices.

The purpose of this project is to ensure that we're able to understand the work we do and code independently.
